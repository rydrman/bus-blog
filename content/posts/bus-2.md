We made it to Calgary! Another beautiful sunny day through the mountains and now were out. Stayed with my uncle Keith and aunt Cathy and got a wonderful hot meal as well. We took some time to look at the seats and discovered how easy they are to remove, so now there's a big empty space at the back! :) This morning we met up with Alex and had some breakfast before heading out towards Saskatchewan...
