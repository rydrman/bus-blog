In the summer of 2018 we already knew that we wouldn't be able to take a honeymoon just yet, but wanted to take at least a small trip as newlyweds. We had never been to Kelowna and decided that it would be a fun weekend to drive the bus up there for a couple of nights.

On the way up, we stopped for a hike at an old railway tunnel in the mountains. There's some really cool history here - learning about all the effort that went into the trans-Canada railway right across the Rockies.

We stayed at a cute little RV park that only had a few spots. It was a really nice and quiet area, and they even had chickens!

We brought our bikes up with us and spent the next day doing a bike wine tour. Except that we are not big on wine so instead we did a lavender farm, honey aviary and some other exploring of the city. We also almost had a run-in with a bear and got yelled at by a few golfers... just a typical day, I suppose!

On the way back out the following day we stopped at a jammery for some tasting.

At some point on the way home, I must have hit a curb because the tire on one of our tag axels got quite low. Thankfully we were out of the mountains at this point and so a quick stop at Canadian tire for an air pump got us enough pressure to make it home and defer the problem for another day!

Thanks for reading!
