Well this is it. After years of searching and wanting I've finally found the perfect fit. This here is my new (old) 1981 coach. It's a Motorcoach Industries (MCI) model MC9. I bought it out here in Vancouver, Canada not 4 days ago. I now have the permits and registration so thus begins the journey home! In two days I will begin the long drive back to Ottawa, Ontario. More to come!
