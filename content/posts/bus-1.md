So there it it. Day one of the journey is over and we're about to start day 2. Yesterday we made it to Kamloops, BC. We left Vancouver around 8pm and headed into the mountains. We didn't know what to expect but there are some long steep hills up here... We definitely had a few points where we could only manage 40 km/h, and downhill I'm keeping it around 60 to stay in control. Thankfully there's room to pass, though; 40 on a limit of 110 makes a few people angry! So today were headed into Calgary, and get to be done with the mountain driving.
