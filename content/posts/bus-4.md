Well, we made it home! From Kenora we headed through Ontario, past Thunder bay and stayed the next night in a little motel in a town with no name :P. In Thunder Bay we ordered some Chinese food and found a beautiful Terry Fox lookout to eat at. We pulled into the parking lot of the lookout and there were literally 9 police cars parked there. We still don't know what they we're doing but they surely weren't doing anything useful...

On Thursday we had quite a long day of driving. As we we're leaving our hotel we stopped to look at a nice waterfall that was pouring into lake superior. 9 hours later we pulled into the Marriot in Sudbury for a very lovely sleep and hot tub.

The drive to Toronto from there was pretty easy. We passed all of the cottage traffic heading out of Toronto and we're very thankful we were headed into the city. After a series of unforeseen events we ended up driving though downtown Toronto... which was an experience (videos to come). My dad took a train from Toronto Saturday night and I met up with the girlfriend, Zara.

Saturday morning we drove back with my brother and two of his friends. Hit some traffic on highway seven but otherwise it was an easy last day for the bus. Overall we spent about $2000 on gas which works out to about $40 an hour :P. But it was definitely worth it! Now I have my own bus parked here and a project for next semester. We already started pulling up some of the floor to see whats underneath :)

Stay tuned for updates from the deconstruction and reconstruction!
