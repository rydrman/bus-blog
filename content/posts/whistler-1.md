Through the winter of 2017/2018, we didn't do much, except keep the solar panels clear and the batteries charged.

Come springtime though, it was time for our annual trip to Whistler!

We loaded up the car and headed to the bus, but were shocked to find a whole rally happening! Our bus was right in the middle of the whole thing, so it took a little time and musical chairs to get us out. This set us back an hour or two but everyone was still in good spirits.

As usual, the sea-to-sky highway presented beautiful vistas and warm sun on our way up the mountain. The bus takes these hills pretty slow but it's hard to be in a rush when you are enjoying such a view.

We settled into our spot in whistler and headed into the village for some dinner. After eating we had ourselves a little fire and settled into the coziness of the bus for the night.

Day two was the real adventure - we were going rock climbing! This was happening in Squamish, so we packed up and headed back towards Vancouver.

This was never intended to be a long trip, and with the adventure over, we headed back home to park the bus. By this time the rally was over (thankfully) and we got back in with much less trouble!
