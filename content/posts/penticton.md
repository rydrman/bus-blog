In 2019 we actually didn't get the bus out at all! We visited it during the summer and took it out on a few short drives, but were a little preoccupied with life. In June of 2019, we bought a condo that flooded the day before we closed. Thankfully it was all covered by insurance but we dealt with a number of contractors over the summer and had our hands full planning and building out everything that we wanted!

In 2020, we only managed to get the bus out once (the world was in a pandemic, of course). Thankfully in August things were going pretty well in BC so we took the chance to head up to Penticton with some family.

We stayed at a beautiful little spot right on the river - at some point in the last couple of years the A/C stopped turning on in the bus (still to be diagnosed) and it was HOT this weekend. Thankfully the river was cold mountain water and became a great place to relax and dip our feet.

Unfortunately, I don't actually have a lot of photos from this trip, but I did get some more driving footage on the way home!
