So here we go!

Now that the floor is all done, things are starting to get built on the inside. This weekend  we finished the back bed area, bunks, and washroom. We framed the bunks with 2x4s and the washroom with 2x3s. Then we used 11mm plywood to panel the ends of the bunks and walls of the bathroom. We figured that if we built the bunk and bathroom walls well, then we could just throw a 2x4 across and lay down the plywood for the back bed.

The bunks are 6 feet long with about 2 feet between them, it's not huge but it leaves lots of the window open and opens up the sight-line to the back. My whole design was done to keep the bus feeling nice and open. I didn't want to close off any windows or make it feel small.

Below are the final pictures from this weekend. The bathroom is the only place in the bus where anything goes right to the ceiling.

I also caulked the stair plates and added an equalizer to finish off the front area :)

The plan next weekend is to build the benches at the front and then the kitchen couters will go in last. The only reason for this is that we want to keep the nice work space in the middle for all the measuring and cutting of the benches.

Hopefully I'll be posting again in a week or so, thanks for reading!
