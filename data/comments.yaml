  content: Hi J, lucky for me my dad has a big enough driveway to fit the bus. As for fuel, it definitely will be expensive to get it home, but I didn't buy it for its fuel economy... It'll get just under 40 L/100 km (or 6 MPG) so you do the math...

    Hey Ryan (is it?)
    Your job so far looks great. I just started doing a conversion on a 1996 MC12 so we are looking at pretty much the exact same bus and workload. I am at the point of striping the inner wall panels and ripping up the floor. I have subscribed so keep the pics coming.

    Hi Ryan, that`s a good looking 9, hard to believe it`s been on the road for 33yrs. Nice and straight looking, from what I can see, doors and panels not all dinged up. Being it just came out of service, it should be in reasonable mechanical condition...having to pass regular safeties. As for engine if it starts up good in 0 weather and blue/grey smoke clears up quickly, it is likely in good shape, Assuming its an automatic? if it shifts well and trans fluid is still red not brown and burnt, it`s probably fine also.
    Too bad you are so far away, would like to see it.
    Let me know if you run into any problems, good luck.
    Earl

    You are making great progress.

    An RV toilet needs to be evacuated as close to straight down as possible. There is no big flush of water like a residential toilet so there is no force to push the waste sideways. The required force is gravity. You may have problems with your current set up.

  content: I have a 75 mci 5 b and you have to do a service brake application once running to get the brakes to fully release . I had the same problem , it would move but was really labouring .I also had the same problem too with our  bathroom sink as you with your toilet, we built our walls between the windows only to find the sink drain would come out in the rear wheel well ! Anyway problem solved, ran the drain to the wall and shrouded it in the through the floor . Nice to see theres other people with the same interest ,great work man !

  content: Hey Ryan, Morgan's dad here..... Just some thoughts from an "Old McGiver Type". Two things, one the bus is really coming together and looks great.  You are doing one bang up job of the interior. The other is to do with your battery power/inverter.  Did you put in a charging supply from the Bus Altenator to keep the inverter battery charged? If you did, did you switch it so your inverter will not draw off the regular bus batteries?  One last thought, do you have a small generator for power? I hope I get to see the bus, you are doing an awesome job!

    Hey Perry, the bus actually has a 24v alternator and power system, so it doesn't really work with the inverter system. My plan is to buy a cheap, used 12v alternator and add it to the engine.This way the starter batteries are always ready and charged, and the house system can do it's own thing. I left space for a small generator, and my inverter actually has the functionality to tart and stop it whenever necessary, but I don't want to spend the money on tit yet...
    You'l have to come see it sometime in Ottawa or when we bring it to Toronto!
